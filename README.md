# GitHub-AlexaSkill-Hack
A quick little Alexa skill to read out the top GitHub repos as found on http://gitmostwanted.com/

This project is not guarenteed to work. I've honestly forgotten how to write Alexa skills. The most
useful thing you can find in this project is a bad parser for the webstie 
(http://gitmostwanted.com/)[http://gitmostwanted.com/]. Other than that, you won't really find much
use.

I just wanted to store this project somewhere so I can get it off my harddrive.
